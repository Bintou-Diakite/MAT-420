PROJECT SUMMARY

 Data Preparation

Converted the Date column to proper datetime format.
Extracted the Week number from each date.
Applied One-Hot Encoding to the Store variable to convert it into numerical features.
Scaled continuous variables
(Temperature, Fuel Price, CPI, Unemployment, Week)
using StandardScaler.

 Train–Test Split

Dataset was split into:
80% training data
20% testing data

The test set was kept untouched during training.

. Model Building

I tested multiple machine-learning models:
 Gradient Boosting Regressor:
Tuned using cross-validation to find best parameters.
Showed strong performance and stability.
Support Vector Regression (SVR):
Tested Linear, Polynomial, and RBF kernels.
Evaluated each using RMSE and R².
Decision Tree Regressor:
Used cross-validation to evaluate performance.
Helps understand feature splits and interpretability.
Neural Network:
PCA was used to reduce features before feeding into a small MLP network.
Cross-Validation
Used K-Fold Cross Validation (5 folds).
This method trains the model multiple times on different splits.
Helps find the best hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.

 Final Evaluation on Test Set

Since the Gradient boost was the best model I applied my test set on it and the resuls was really similar compared to the actual weekly sales values.
